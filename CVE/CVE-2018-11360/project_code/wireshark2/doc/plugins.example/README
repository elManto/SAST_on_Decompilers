This is an example of how to build a Wireshark plugin out-of-tree.

Tested on Linux using GCC 7. Note this builds against Wireshark's *installed*
version. You should of course adapt to your own needs.

To build/install the plugin:

$ autoreconf -v -i
$ PREFIX=/usr/local
$ ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig"
$ make
$ sudo make install # or single-user: make install-home
