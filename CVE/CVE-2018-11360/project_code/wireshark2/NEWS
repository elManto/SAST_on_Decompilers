What's New

   Many user interface improvements have been made. See the New and
   Updated Features section below for more details.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 2.4.0:
     * Display filter buttons can now be edited, disabled, and removed via
       a context menu directly from the toolbar
     * Drag & Drop filter fields to the display filter toolbar or edit to
       create a button on the fly or apply the filter as a display filter.
     * Application startup time has been reduced.
     * Some keyboard shortcut mix-ups have been resolved by assigning new
       shortcuts to Edit -> Copy methods.
     * TShark now supports color using the --color option.
     * The "matches" display filter operator is now case-insensitive.
     * Display expression (button) preferences have been converted to a
       UAT. This puts the display expressions in their own file. Wireshark
       still supports preference files that contain the old preferences,
       but new preference files will be written without the old fields.
     * SMI private enterprise numbers are now read from the
       "enterprises.tsv" configuration file.
     * The QUIC dissector has been renamed to Google QUIC (quic -> gquic).
     * The selected packet number can now be shown in the Status Bar by
       enabling Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout -> Show selected
       packet number.
     * File load time in the Status Bar is now disabled by default and can
       be enabled in Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout -> Show file load
       time.
     * Support for the G.729A codec in the RTP Player is now added via the
       bcg729 library.
     * Support for hardware-timestamping of packets has been added.
     * Improved NetMon .cap support with comments, event tracing, network
       filter, network info types and some Message Analyzer exported
       types.
     * The personal plugins folder on Linux/Unix is now
       ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins.
     * TShark can print flow graphs using -z flow...
     * Capinfos now prints SHA256 hashes in addition to RIPEMD160 and
       SHA1. MD5 output has been removed.
     * The packet editor has been removed. (This was a GTK+ only
       experimental feature.)
     * Support BBC micro:bit Bluetooth profile
     * The Linux and UNIX installation step for Wireshark will now install
       headers required to build plugins. A pkg-config file is provided to
       help with this (see doc/plugins.example for details). Note you must
       still rebuild all plugins between minor releases (X.Y).
     * The Windows installers and packages now ship with Qt 5.9.4.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [1]https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [2]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
