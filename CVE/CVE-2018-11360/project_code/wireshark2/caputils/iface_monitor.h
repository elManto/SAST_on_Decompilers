 * XXX - we really want "gone", not "down", where "gone" may include
 * "down" if the OS requires an interface to be up in order to start
 * a capture on it (as is the case in Linux and in macOS prior to
 * Lion), but should also include *gone*, as in "there is no longer
 * an interface with this name, so it's neither down nor up".

 * we might want is "add", "remove", and "modify" as the events.
