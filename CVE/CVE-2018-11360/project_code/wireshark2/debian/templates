Template: wireshark-common/install-setuid
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?
 Dumpcap can be installed in a way that allows members of the "wireshark"
 system group to capture packets. This is recommended over the
 alternative of running Wireshark/Tshark directly as root, because
 less of the code will run with elevated privileges.
 .
 For more detailed information please see
 /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian.
 .
 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by
 default. If in doubt, it is suggested to leave it disabled.

Template: wireshark-common/addgroup-failed
Type: error
_Description: Creating the wireshark system group failed
 The wireshark group does not exist, and creating it failed, so
 Wireshark cannot be configured to capture traffic as an unprivileged
 user.
 .
 Please create the wireshark system group and try configuring
 wireshark-common again.

Template: wireshark-common/group-is-user-group
Type: error
_Description: The wireshark group is a system group
 The wireshark group exists as a user group, but the preferred
 configuration is for it to be created as a system group.
 .
 As a result, purging wireshark-common will not remove the wireshark
 group, but everything else should work properly.

Template: wireshark-common/setcap-failed
Type: error
_Description: Setting capabilities for dumpcap failed
 The attempt to use Linux capabilities to grant packet-capturing
 privileges to the dumpcap binary failed. Instead, it has had the
 set-user-id bit set.

Template: wireshark-common/group-removal-failed
Type: error
_Description: Removal of the wireshark group failed
 When the wireshark-common package is configured to allow
 non-superusers to capture packets the postinst script of
 wireshark-common creates the wireshark group as a system group.
 .
 However, on this system the wireshark group is a user group instead of
 being a system group, so purging wireshark-common did not remove it.
 .
 If the group is no longer needed, please remove it manually.
