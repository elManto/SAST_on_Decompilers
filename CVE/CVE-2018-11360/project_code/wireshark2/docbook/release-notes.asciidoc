=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.4.0:

* Display filter buttons can now be edited, disabled, and removed via a context
  menu directly from the toolbar
* Drag & Drop filter fields to the display filter toolbar or edit to create
  a button on the fly or apply the filter as a display filter.
* Application startup time has been reduced.
* Some keyboard shortcut mix-ups have been resolved by assigning new shortcuts
  to Edit -> Copy methods.
* TShark now supports color using the --color option.
* The "matches" display filter operator is now case-insensitive.
* Display expression (button) preferences have been converted to a UAT.
  This puts the display expressions in their own file.  Wireshark still
  supports preference files that contain the old preferences, but new
  preference files will be written without the old fields.
* SMI private enterprise numbers are now read from the "enterprises.tsv" configuration file.
* The QUIC dissector has been renamed to **G**oogle QUIC (quic -> **g**quic).
* The selected packet number can now be shown in the Status Bar by enabling
  Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout -> Show selected packet number.
* File load time in the Status Bar is now disabled by default and can be enabled in
  Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout -> Show file load time.
* Support for the G.729A codec in the RTP Player is now added via the bcg729 library.
* Support for hardware-timestamping of packets has been added.
* Improved NetMon .cap support with comments, event tracing, network filter,
  network info types and some Message Analyzer exported types.
* The personal plugins folder on Linux/Unix is now {tilde}/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins.
* TShark can print flow graphs using `-z flow…`
* Capinfos now prints SHA256 hashes in addition to RIPEMD160 and SHA1. MD5 output
  has been removed.
* The packet editor has been removed. (This was a GTK+ only experimental feature.)
* Support BBC micro:bit Bluetooth profile
* The Linux and UNIX installation step for Wireshark will now install
  headers required to build plugins. A pkg-config file is provided to
  help with this (see doc/plugins.example for details). Note you must
  still rebuild all plugins between minor releases (X.Y).
* The Windows installers and packages now ship with Qt 5.9.4.
* The generic data dissector can now uncompress zlib compressed data.

//=== Major API Changes

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to find the default
locations on your system.

== Known Problems

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
(ws_buglink:1419[])

The BER dissector might infinitely loop.
(ws_buglink:1516[])

Capture filters aren't applied when capturing from named pipes.
(ws_buglink:1814[])

Filtering tshark captures with read filters (-R) no longer works.
(ws_buglink:2234[])

Application crash when changing real-time option.
(ws_buglink:4035[])

Wireshark and TShark will display incorrect delta times in some cases.
(ws_buglink:4985[])

Wireshark should let you work with multiple capture files. (ws_buglink:10488[])
