 * Mark Paulus - process a "Subject" from the MAPI fields, if it's not defined
        in the usual location.
1.5 - Sep 14, 2004
 * Implemented a change suggested by "Larry Jones" to allow the Compressed RTF
        stuff to compile on older compilers.  Basically just pre-declaring
        variables.
1.3 - Dec 29th, 2003
 * Fixed a bug in MAPISysTimeToDTR (ytnef.c) where the dates were wrong in the
        upcoming leap year. (SR Bug: 867041)  This should fix the "off-by-one
        day" bug and the "infinite hang" bug for events on New Years Day.
1.1 - Nov 20th, 2003
 * Fixed a bug in the way the Multi-valued Mapi properties were handled
        Previously only the first 2 values were read, leaving the others
        uninitialized, leading to segfaults.
