v1.9 - January 2, 2017
* Unify libytnef and ytnef tools into a single build & package (Thanks @jmallach)
* Fix applied for CVE-2010-5109
* Various fixes for errors found via Static Analysis (cppcheck)
* Various memory leaks plugged (Thanks @slonik-v-domene)
* Bugfix for a broken "uniqueness" checker
* Lots of formatting & documentation cleanups

Now that the two packages are unified into a single install & build, I've had
to choose a unifier of Version Numbers.  I chose 1.9 .
