# Project 

WavPack (https://github.com/dbry/WavPack), commit 8948be9fd118cd3646eb83c9bc10afca478b0e32

# Description

The bug is a division by zero originated by a wrong check in the file ```cli/dsdiff.c```, line 282, in the function ```ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig```.

# Detections

1. cppcheck
2. Infer
3. Clang Static Analyser 
4. ikos
5. joern 

# Decompiled code

Tools work on the decompiled code as well (the division 'operation' is decompiled in a proper way and it preserves the type system of the operands)
