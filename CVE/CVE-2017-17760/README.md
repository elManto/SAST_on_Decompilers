OpenCVE (https://github.com/opencv/opencv), commit 7bbe1a53cfc097b82b1589f7915a2120de39274c 

# Description

In the file ```modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp```, line 336, a ```memcpy``` is 
invoked woth the wrong size, leading to an out-of-bound write into the ```data```
stack buffer


# Detections

1. flawfinder
2. scan-build
3. joern (probably)
4. ikos 

# Decompiled code

The bug is easy to spot since all the tools generate a warning for the 'memcpy'. However, for ikos you need to force the intra-procedural analysis since the method is virtual and so it is never invoked directly (i.e., the method is invoked from the abstract class, then at run-time the correct address is resolved, but static analysis tools cannot discover it)

# Actions

Time 4h
 
1. Usual things
2. There are some nested assembly procedures: we can remove them since the static analysis tools dont consider them
